media will not show the magnitude of this crowd even i when i turned it on today i looked and i saw the thousands of people here but you dont see the hundreds of thousands of people behind you because they dont want to show that we have hundreds of thousands of people here and i just want them to be recognized by the fake news media turn your cameras please and show whats really happening out here because these people are not going to take it any longer theyre not going to take it any longer go ahead turn your cameras please would you show they came from all over the world actually but they came from all over our country i just really want to see what they do i just want to see how theyre covered ive never seen anything like it but it would be really great if we could be covered fairly by the media the media is the biggest problem we have as far as im concerned the single biggest problem the fake news and the big tech big tech is now coming into their own we beat em four years ago we surprised them we took them by surprise and this year they rigged an election they rigged it like theyve never rigged an election before and by the way last night they didnt do a bad job either if you notice im honest and and i just again i want to thank you its just a great honor to have this kind of crowd and to be before you and hundreds of thousands of american patriots who are committed to the honesty of our elections and the integrity of our glorious republic all of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen by emboldened radical left democrats  which is what theyre doing  and stolen by the fake news media thats what theyve done and what theyre doing we will never give up we will never concede it doesnt happen you dont concede when theres theft involved our country has had enough we will not take it anymore and thats what this is all about and to use a favorite term that all of you people really came up with we will stop the steal  today i will lay out just some of the evidence proving that we won this election and we won it by a landslide this was not a close election  you know i say sometimes jokingly but theres no joke about it ive been in two elections i won em both and the second one i won much bigger than the first okay almost  million people voted for our campaign the most of any incumbent president by far in the history of our country twelve million more people than four years ago and i was told by the real pollsters  we do have real pollsters  they know that we were going to do well and we were going to win but i was told if i went from  million which we had four years ago to  million there was no chance of losing well we didnt go to  we went to  million and they say we lost we didnt lose and by the way does anybody believe that joe had  million votes does anybody believe that he had  million computer votes its a disgrace theres never been anything like that you could take third world countries just take a look take third world countries their elections are more honest than what weve been going through in this country its a disgrace its a disgrace even when you look at last night theyre all running around like chickens with their heads cut off with boxes and nobody knows what the hell is going on theres never been anything like this we will not let them silence your voices were not going to let it happen not going to let it happen crowd begins chanting fight for trump thank you and id love to have if those tens of thousands of people would be allowed the military the secret service we want to thank

thats a tough act to follow those two john is one of the most brilliant lawyers in the country and he looked at this and he said what an absolute disgrace that this could be happening to our constitution and he looked at mike pence and i hope mike is going to do the right thing i hope so i hope so because if mike pence does the right thing we win the election all he has to do all this is this is from the number one or certainly one of the top constitutional lawyers in our country he has the absolute right to do it were supposed to protect our country support our country support our constitution and protect our constitution states want to revote the states got defrauded they were given false information they voted on it now they want to recertify they want it back all vice president pence has to do is send it back to the states to recertify and we become president and you are the happiest people and i actually i just spoke to mike i said mike that doesnt take courage what takes courage is to do nothing that takes courage and then were stuck with a president who lost the election by a lot and we have to live with that for four more years were just not going to let that happen many of you have traveled from all across the nation to be here and i want to thank you for the extraordinary love  thats what it is theres never been a movement like this ever ever for the extraordinary love for this amazing country and this amazing movement crowd chants we love trump thank you by the way this goes all the way back past the washington monument do you believe this look at this unfortunately they gave the press the prime seats i cant stand that no but you look at that behind  i wish theyd flip those cameras and look  behind you that is the most amazing sight when they make a mistake you get to see it on television amazing amazing all the way back and dont worry we will not take the name off the washington monument we will not cancel culture you know they wanted to get rid of the jefferson memorial either take it down or just put somebody else in there i dont think thats going to happen it damn well better not although with this administration if this happens it could happen youll see some really bad things happen theyll knock out lincoln too by the way theyve been taking his statue down but then we signed a little law you hurt our monuments you hurt our heroes you go to jail for  years and everything stopped you notice that it stopped it all stopped and they could use rudy back in new york city rudy they could use you your citys going to hell they want rudy giuliani back in new york well get a little younger version of rudy is that okay rudy were gathered together in the heart of our nations capital for one very very basic and simple reason to save our democracy you know most candidates on election evening and of course this thing goes on so long they still dont have any idea what the votes are we still have congressional seats under review they have no idea theyve totally lost control theyve used the pandemic as a way of defrauding the people in an improper election but you know you know when you see this and when you see whats happening number one they all say sir well never let it happen again i said thats good but what about eight weeks ago you know they try and get you to go they say sir in four years youre guaranteed i said im not interested right now do me a favor go back eight weeks i want to go back eight weeks lets go back eight weeks we want to go back and we want to getthis right because were going to have somebody in there that should not be in there and our country will be destroyed and were not going to stand for that for years democrats have gotten away with election fraud and weak republicans and thats why there are so many weak republicans and we have great ones jim jordan and some of these guys theyre out there fighting the house guys are fighting but its incredible many of the republicans  i helped them get in i helped them get elected i helped mitch get elected crowd boos i helped i could name  of them lets say i wont bore you with it  and then all of a sudden you have something like this that its like oh gee maybe ill talk to the president sometime later no its amazing the weak republicans theyre pathetic republicans and thats what happens if this happened to the democrats thered be hell all over the country going on thered be hell all over the country but just remember this youre stronger youre smarter youve got more going than anybody and they try and demean everybody having to do with us and youre the real people youre the people that built this nation youre not the people that tore down our nation the weak republicans  and thats it i really believe it i think im going to use the term the weak republicans  youve got a lot of them and youve got a lot of great ones but youve got a lot of weak ones theyve turned a blind eye even as democrats enacted policies that shipped away our jobs weakened our military threw open our borders and put america last did you see the other day where joe biden said  i want to get rid of the america first policy whats that all about get rid of how do you say i want to get rid of america first even if youre gonna do it dont talk about it right unbelievable what we have to go through what we have to go through and you have to get your people to fight and if they dont fight we have to primary the hell out of the ones that dont fight you primary em were gonna let you know who they are i can already tell you frankly but this year using the pretext of the china virus and the scam of mailin ballots democrats attempted the most brazen and outrageous election theft and theres never been anythinglike this  its a pure theft  in american history everybody knows it that election our election was over at ten oclock in the evening were leading pennsylvania michigan georgia by hundreds of thousands of votes and then late in the evening or early in the morning boom these explosions of bullshit and all of a sudden crowd roars all of a sudden it started to happen dont forget when romney got beat romney oy did you see his i wonder if he enjoyed his flight in last night but when romney got beaten you know he stands up like youre more typical well id like to congratulate the victor the victor who was the victor mitt id like to congratulate they dont go and look at the facts now i dont know he got he got slaughtered probably maybe it was okay maybe it was thats what happened but we look at the facts and our election was so corrupt that in the history of this country weve never seen anything like it you can go all the way back you know america is blessed with elections all over the world they talk about our elections you know what the world says about us now they say we dont have free and fair elections and you know what else we dont have a free and fair press our media is not free its not fair it suppresses thought it suppresses speech and its become the enemy of the people its become the enemy of the people its the biggest problem we have in this country no third world countries would even attempt to do what we caught them doing and youll hear about that in just a few minutes republicans are constantly fighting like a boxer with his hands tied behind his back its like a boxer and we want to be so nice we want to be so respectful of everybody including bad people and were going to have to fight much harder and mike pence is going to have to come through for us and if he doesnt that will be a sad day for our country because youre sworn to uphold our constitution now it is up to congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy and after this were going to walk down  and ill be there with you  were going to walk down were going to walk down any one you want but i think right here were going to walk down to the capitol and were going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women and were probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them because youll never take back our country with weakness you have to show strength and you have to be strong we have come to demand that congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated lawfully slated i know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard today we will see whether republicans stand strong for integrity of our elections but whether or not they stand strong for our country our country our country has been under siege for a long time far longer than this four year period weve set it on a much straighter course a much and we i thought you know four more years i thought it would be easy wed created the greatest economy in history we rebuilt our military we get you the biggest tax cuts in history right we got you the biggest regulation cuts theres no president whether its four years eight years or in one case more got anywhere near the regulation cuts you used to take  years to get a highway approved now were down to two i want to get it down to one but were down to two and it may get rejected for environmental or safety reasons but we got it down to safety we created space force look at what we did our military has been totally rebuilt so we create space force which by and of itself is a major achievement for an administration and with us its one of so many different things right to try everybody know about right to try we did things that nobody ever thought possible we took care of our vets our vets the va now has the highest rating   percent  the highest rating that its had from the beginning  percent approval rating always you watch the va it was on television every night people living in a horrible horrible manner we got that done we got accountability done we got it so that now in the va you dont have to wait for four weeks six weeks eight weeks four months to see a doctor if you cant get a doctor you go outside you get the doctor you have them taken care of and we pay the doctor and weve not only made life wonderful for so many people weve saved tremendous amounts of money far secondarily but weve saved a lot of money and now we have the right to fire bad people in the va we had  people that treated our veterans horribly in prime time they would not have treated our veterans badly but they treated our veterans horribly and we have whats called the account of the va accountability act and the accountability says that if we see somebody in there that doesnt treat our vets well or they steal they rob they do things badly we say joe youre fired get out of here before you couldnt do that you couldnt do that before  so weve taken care of things weve done things like nobodys ever thought possible and thats part of the reason that many people dont like us because weve done too much but weve done it quickly and we were going to sit home and watch a big victory and everybody had us down for a victory it was going to be great and now were out here fighting i said to somebody i was going to take a few days and relax after our big electoral victory ten oclock it was over but i was going to take a few days and i can say this since our election i believe which was such a catastrophe when i watched and even these guys points to the media knew what happened they know what happened theyre saying wow pennsylvanias insurmountable wow wisconsin look at the big leads we had right even though the press said we would lose wisconsin by  points even though the press said ohios going to be close we set a record floridas going to be close we set a record texas is going to be close texas is going to be close we set a record and we set a record with hispanics with the black community we set a record with everybody today we see a very important event though because right over there right there we see the event gonna take place and im going to be watching because history is going to be made were going to see whether or not we have great and courageous leaders or whether or not we have leaders that should be ashamed of themselves throughout history throughout eternity theyll be ashamed and you know what if they do the wrong thing we should never ever forget that they did never forget we should never ever forget that with only three of the seven states in question we win the presidency of the united states and by the way its much more important today than it was  hours ago because and i spoke to david perdue  what a great person  and kelly loeffler two great people but it was a setup and you know i said we have no back line anymore the only back line the only line of demarcation the only line that we have is the veto of the president of the united states so this is now what were doing a far more important election than it was two days ago i want to thank the more than  members of the house those are warriors theyre over there working like youve never seen before studying talking actually going all the way back studying the roots of the constitution because they know we have the right to send back a bad vote that was illegally gotten they gave these people bad things to vote for and they voted because what did they know and then when they found out a few weeks later again it took them four years to devise this scheme and the only unhappy person in the united states single most unhappy is hillary clinton because she said why didnt you do this for me four years ago why didnt you do this for me four years ago change the votes ten thousand in michigan you could have changed the whole thing but shes not too happy you notice you dont see her anymore what happened wheres hillary where is she but i want to thank all of those congressmen and women i also want to thank our  most courageous members of the us senate senator ted cruz senator ron johnson senator josh hawley kelly loeffler and kelly loeffler ill tell you she has been shes been so great she worked so hard so lets give her and david a little special hand because it was rigged against him lets give her and david kelly loeffler david perdue they fought a good race they never had a shot that equipment should never have been allowed to be used and i was telling these people dont let em use this stuff marsha blackburn terrific person mike braun indiana steve daines great guy bill hagerty john kennedy james lankford cynthia lummis tommy tuberville hes the coach and roger marshall we want to thank them senators have stepped up we want to thank them i actually think though it takes again more courage not to step up and i think a lot of those people are going to find that out and you better start looking at your leadership because your leadership has led you down the tubes you know we dont want to give  to people we want to give them six hundred dollars oh great how does that play politically pretty good and this has nothing to do with politics but how does it play politically china destroyed these people we didnt destroy em china destroyed them totally destroyed them we want to give them  and they just wouldnt change i said give them  well pay it back well pay it back fast you already owe  trillion give them a couple of bucks let em live give them a couple of bucks and some of the people here disagree with me on that but i just say look you got to let people live and how does that play though okay number one its the right thing to do but how does that play politically i think its the primary reason one of the primary reasons the other was just pure cheating that was the primary superprimary reason but you cant do that you got to use your head as you know the media has constantly asserted the outrageous lie that there was no evidence of widespread fraud you ever see these people while there is no evidence of fraud oh really well im going to read you pages i hope you dont get bored listening to it promise dont get bored listening to it all those hundreds of thousands of people back there move them up please yeah all of them all these people dont get bored dont get angry at me because youre gonna get bored because its so much the american people do not believe the corrupt fake news anymore they have ruined their reputation but you know it used to be that theyd argue with me id fight so id fight theyd fight id fight theyd fight boop boop youd believe me youd believe them somebody comes out you know they had their point of view i had my point of view but youd have an argument now what they do is they go silent its called suppression and thats what happens in a communist country thats what they do they suppress you you dont fight with them anymore unless its a bad story they have a little bad story about me they make it ten times worse and its a major headline but hunter biden they dont talk about him what happened to hunter wheres hunter where is hunter they dont talk about him now watch all the sets will go off well they cant do that because they get good ratings their ratings are too good no now wheres hunter you know and how come joe was allowed to give a billion dollars of money to get rid of the prosecutor in ukraine how does that happen id ask you that question how does that happen can you imagine if i said that if i said that it would be a whole different ball game and how come hunter gets three and a half million dollars from the mayor of moscows wife and gets hundreds of thousands of dollars to sit on an energy board even though he admits he has no knowledge of energy and millions of dollars up front and how come they go into china and they leave with billions of dollars to manage have you managed money before no i havent oh thats good heres about  billion no they dont talk about that no we have a corrupt media theyve gone silent theyve gone dead i now realize how good it was if you go back  years i realize how good even though i didnt necessarily love em i realized how good it was like a cleansing motion right  but we dont have that anymore we dont have a fair media anymore its suppression and you have to be very careful with that and theyve lost all credibility in this country we will not be intimidated into accepting the hoaxes and the lies that weve been forced to believe over the past several weeks  weve amassed overwhelming evidence about a fake election this is the presidential election last night was a little bit better because of the fact that we had a lot of eyes watching one specific state but they cheated like hell anyway you have one of the dumbest governors in the united states and you know when i endorsed him  i didnt know this guy  at the request of david perdue he said friend of mines running for governor whats his name and you know the rest he was in fourth place fifth place i dont know he was way he was doing poorly i endorsed him he went like a rocket ship and he won and then i had to beat stacey abrams with this guy brian kemp i had to beat stacey abrams and i had to beat oprah who used to be a friend of mine you know i was on her last show or the last week and she picked the five outstanding people i dont think she thinks that anymore once i ran for president i didnt notice there were too many calls coming in from oprah believe it or not she used to like me but i was one of the five outstanding people and i had to campaign against michelle obama and barack hussein obama against stacey and i had brian kemp he weighs  pounds he said he played offensive line in football im trying to figure that out im still trying to figure that out said that the other night i was a offensive lineman im saying really that must have been a very small team crowd laughs but i look at that and i look at whats happened and he turned out to be a disaster this stuff happens you know look im not happy with the supreme court they love to rule against me i picked three people i fought like hell for them for one in particular i thought they all said sir cut him loose hes killing us senators you know very loyal senators theyre very loyal people sir cut him loose hes killing us sir cut him loose sir ill never i must have gotten half of the senators i said no i cant do that its unfair to him and its unfair to the family he didnt do anything wrong they made up stories they were all made up stories he didnt do anything wrong cut him loose sir i said no i wont do that we got him through and you know what they couldnt give a damn they couldnt give a damn let em rule the right way but it almost seems that theyre all going out of their way to hurt all of us and to hurt our country to hurt our country you know i read a story in one of the newspapers recently how i control the three supreme court justices i control them theyre puppets i read it about bill barr that hes my personal attorney that hell do anything for me and i said you know it really is genius because what they do is that and it makes it really impossible for them to ever give you a victory because all of a sudden bill barr changed if you hadnt noticed i like bill barr but he changed because he didnt want to be considered my personal attorney and the supreme court they rule against me so much you know why because the story is  i havent spoken to any of em any of them since virtually they got in  but the story is that theyre my puppets right that theyre puppets and now the only way they can get out of that because they hate that  its not good on the social circuit  and the only way they get out is to rule against trump so lets rule against trump and they do that so i want to congratulate them but it shows you the medias genius in fact probably if i was the media id do it the same way i hate to say it but we got to get them straightened out today for the sake of our democracy for the sake of our constitution and for the sake of our children we lay out the case for the entire world to hear do you want to hear it crowd cheers in every single swing state local officials state officials almost all democrats made illegal and unconstitutional changes to election procedures without the mandated approvals by the state legislatures that these changes pave the way for fraud on a scale never seen before and i think we can go a long way outside of our country when i say that so just in a nutshell you cant make a change on voting for a federal election unless the state legislature approves it no judge can do it nobody can do it only a legislature so as an example in pennsylvania or whatever you have a republican legislature you have a democrat mayor and you have a lot of democrats all over the place they go to the legislature the legislature laughs at them says were not going to do that they say thank you very much then they go make the changes themselves they do it anyway and thats totally illegal thats totally illegal you cant do that in pennsylvania the democrat secretary of state and the democrat state supreme court justices illegally abolished the signature verification requirements just  days prior to the election so think of what they did no longer is there signature verification oh thats okay we want voter id by the way but no longer is there signature verification  days before the election they say we dont want it you know why they dont want to because they want to cheat thats the only reason who would even think of that we dont want to verify a signature there were over  more ballots counted in pennsylvania  now think of this  you had  more ballots than you had voters that means you had two hundred where did they come from you know where they came from somebodys imagination whatever they needed so in pennsylvania you had  more votes than you had voters and its  the numbers actually much greater than that now that was as of a week ago  and this is a mathematical impossibility unless you want to say its a total fraud so pennsylvania was defrauded over  ballots in pennsylvania were cast by people whose names and dates of birth match individuals who died in  and prior to the election think of that dead people lots of dead people thousands and some dead people actually requested an application crowd laughs that bothers me not only are they voting they want an application to vote one of them was  years ago they died its incredible over  ballots were cast by out of state voters so these are voters that dont live in the state and by the way these numbers are what they call outcome determinative meaning these numbers far surpass  i lost by a very little bit  these numbers are massive massive more than  votes in pennsylvania were illegally counted even though they were received after election day in other words they were received after election day lets count em anyway and what they did in many cases is they did fraud they took the date and they moved it back so that it no longer is after election day and more than  ballots in pennsylvania were reported received back  they got back  before they were ever supposedly mailed out in other words you got the ballot back before you mailed it which is also logically and logistically impossible right think of that one you got the ballot back lets send the ballot so theyve already been sent but we got the ballot back before they were sent i dont think thats too good right twentyfive thousand ballots in pennsylvania were requested by nursing home residents all in a single giant batch not legal indicating an enormous illegal ballot harvesting operation youre not allowed to do it against the law the day before the election the state of pennsylvania reported the number of absentee ballots that had been sent out yet this number was suddenly and drastically increased by  people it was increased nobody knows where it came from by  ballots one day after the election it remains totally unexplained they said well we cant uh figure that now thats many many times what it would take to overthrow the state  just that one element  ballots appeared from nowhere right after the election by the way pennsylvania has now seen all of this they didnt know because it was so quick they had a vote they voted but now they see all this stuff its all come to light doesnt happen that fast and they want to recertify their votes they want to recertify but the only way that can happen is if mike pence agrees to send it back mike pence has to agree to send it back crowd chants send back and many people in congress want to send back and think of what youre doing lets say you dont do it somebody says well we have to obey the constitution and you are because youre protecting our country and youre protecting the constitution so you are but think of what happens lets say theyre stiffs and theyre stupid people and they say well we really have no choice even though pennsylvania and other states want to redo their votes they want to see the numbers they already have the numbers go very quickly and they want to redo their legislature because many of these votes were taken as i said because it wasnt approved by their legislature you know that in itself is illegal and then you have the scam and thats all of the things that were talking about but think of this if you dont do that that means you will have a president of the united states for four years with his wonderful son you will have a president who lost all of these states or you will have a president to put it another way who was voted on by a bunch of stupid people who lost all of these states you will have an illegitimate president thats what youll have and we cant let that happen these are the facts that you wont hear from the fake news media its all part of the suppression effort they dont want to talk about it they dont want to talk about it in fact when i started talking about that i guarantee you a lot of the television sets and a lot of those cameras went off and thats a lot of cameras back there but a lot of them went off but these are the things you dont hear about you dont hear what you just heard im going to go over a few more states but you dont hear it from the people who want to deceive you and demoralize you and control you big tech media just like the suppression polls that said were going to lose wisconsin by  points well we won wisconsin they dont have it that way because they lost just by a little sliver but they had me down the day before washington postabc poll down  points i called up a real pollster i said what is that sir thats called a suppression poll i think youre going to win wisconsin sir i said but why dont they make it four or five points because then people vote but when youre down  they say hey im not going to waste my time i love the president but theres no way despite that despite that we won wisconsin its going to see i mean youll see but thats called suppression because a lot of people when they see that its very interesting this pollster said sir if youre down three four five people vote when you go down  they say lets save lets go and have dinner and lets watch the presidential defeat tonight on television darling and just like the radical left tries to blacklist you on social media every time i put out a tweet thats even if its totally correct totally correct i get a flag i get a flag and they also dont let you get out you know on twitter its very hard to come onto my account its very hard to get out a message they dont let the message get out nearly like they should but ive had many people say i cant get on your twitter i dont care about twitter twitters bad news theyre all bad news but you know what if you want to if you want to get out a message and if you want to go through big tech social media they are really  if youre a conservative if youre a republican if you have a big voice  i guess they call it shadowbanned right shadow banned they shadowban you and it should be illegal ive been telling these republicans get rid of section  and for some reason mitch and the group they dont want to put it in there and they dont realize that thats going to be the end of the republican party as we know it but its never going to be the end of us never let them get out let the weak ones get out this is a time for strength they also want to indoctrinate your children in school by teaching them things that arent so they want to indoctrinate your children its all part of a comprehensive assault on our democracy and the american people are finally standing up and saying no this crowd is again a testament to it i did no advertising i did nothing you do have some groups that are big supporters i want to thank that amy and everybody we have some incredible supporters incredible but we didnt do anything this just happened two months ago we had a massive crowd come down to washington i said what are they there for sir theyre there for you we have nothing to do with it these groups are forming theyre forming all over the united states and we got to remember in a year from now youre going to start working on congress and we got to get rid of the weak congress people the ones that arent any good the liz cheneys of the world we got to get rid of them we got to get rid you know she never wants a soldier brought home twenty i brought a lot of our soldiers home i dont know some wont like it theyre in countries that nobody even knows the name nobody knows where they are theyre dying theyre great but theyre dying theyre losing their arms their legs their face i brought em back home largely back home afghanistan iraq remember i used to say in the old days dont go in iraq but if you go and keep the oil we didnt keep the oil so stupid so stupid these people and iraq has billions and billions of dollars now in the bank and what did we do we get nothing we never get but we do actually we kept the oil here okay we did good we got rid of the isis caliphate we got rid of plenty of different things that everybody knows and the rebuilding of our military in three years people said it couldnt be done and it was all made in the usa all made in the usa best equipment in the world in wisconsin corrupt democratrun cities deployed more than  illegal unmanned unsecured drop boxes which collected a minimum of  unlawful votes it was razor thin the loss this one thing alone is much more than we would need but there are many things they have these lock boxes and you know they pick them up and they disappear for two days people would say wheres that box that disappeared nobody even knew where the hell it was in addition over  absentee votes were counted in wisconsin without a valid absentee ballot application so they had a vote but they had no application and thats illegal in wisconsin meaning those votes were blatantly done in opposition to state law and they came  percent from democrat areas such as milwaukee and madison  percent in madison  votes were deposited in socalled human drop boxes you know what that is right where operatives stuff thousands of unsecured ballots into duffel bags on park benches across the city in complete defiance of ceaseanddesist letters from the state legislature the state legislature said dont do it theyre the only ones that can approve it they gave tens of thousands of votes they came in duffel bags where the hell did they come from according to eyewitness testimony postal service workers in wisconsin were also instructed to illegally back date approximately  ballots the margin of difference in wisconsin was less than  votes each one of these things alone wins us the state great state we love the state we won the state in georgia your secretary of state who  i cant believe this guys a republican he loves recording telephone conversations you know that was a i thought it was a great conversation personally so did a lot of people love that conversation because it says whats going on these people are crooked theyre  percent in my opinion one of the most corrupt between your governor and your secretary of state and now you have it again last night just take a look at what happened what a mess and the democrat party operators entered into an illegal and unconstitutional settlement agreement that drastically weakened signature verification and other election security procedures stacey abrams she took them to lunch  and i beat her two years ago with a bad candidate brian kemp  but they took the democrats took the republicans to lunch because the secretary of state had no clue what the hell was happening unless he did have a clue thats interesting maybe he was with the other side but weve been trying to get verifications of signatures in fulton county they wont let us do it the only reason they wont is because well find things in the hundreds of thousands why wouldnt they let us verify signatures in fulton county which is known for being very corrupt they wont do it they go to some other county where you would live i said thats not the problem the problem is fulton county home of stacey abrams she did a good job i congratulate her but it was done in such a way that we cant let this stuff happen we wont have a country if it happens as a result georgias absentee ballot rejection rate was more than  times lower than previous levels because the criteria was so off fortyeight counties in georgia with thousands and thousands of votes rejected zero ballots there wasnt one ballot in other words in a year in which more mailin ballots were sent than ever before and more people were voting by mail for the first time the rejection rate was drastically lower than it had ever been before the only way this can be explained is if tens of thousands of illegitimate votes were added to the tally thats the only way you can explain it by the way youre talking about tens of thousands if georgia had merely rejected the same number of unlawful ballots as in other years there should have been approximately  ballots rejected far more than what we needed to win just over  they should find those votes they should absolutely find that just over  votes thats all we need they defrauded us out of a win in georgia and were not going to forget it theres only one reason the democrats could possibly want to eliminate signature matching oppose voter id and stop citizenship confirmation are you a citizen youre not allowed to ask that question because they want to steal the election the radical left knows exactly what theyre doing theyre ruthless and its time that somebody did something about it and mike pence i hope youre going to stand up for the good of our constitution crowd cheers and for the good of our country and if youre not im going to be very disappointed in you i will tell you right now im not hearing good stories  in fulton county republican poll watchers were ejected in some cases physically from the room under the false pretense of a pipe burst water main burst everybody leave which we now know was a total lie then election officials pull boxes  democrats  and suitcases of ballots out from under a table you all saw it on television totally fraudulent and illegally scanned them for nearly two hours totally unsupervised tens of thousands of votes this act coincided with a mysterious vote dump of up to  votes for joe biden almost none for trump oh that sounds fair that was at  am the georgia secretary of state and pathetic governor of georgia have reached although he says im a great president you know i sort of maybe have to change he said the other day yes i dont disagree with the president hes been a great president oh good thanks thank you very much because of him and others yeah brian kemp vote him the hell out of office please well his rates are so low you know his approval rating now i think it just reached a record low theyve rejected five separate appeals for an independent and comprehensive audit of signatures in fulton county even without an order the number of fraudulent ballots that weve identified across the state is staggering over  ballots in georgia were cast by individuals whose names and dates at birth match georgia residents who died in  and prior to the election more than  ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match incarcerated felons in georgia prisons people who are not allowed to vote more than  illegal ballots were cast by individuals who do not appear on the states own voter rolls over  illegal ballots were cast by individuals who registered to vote using an address listed as vacant according to the postal service at least  ballots in georgia were cast by people whose registrations were illegally backdated sixtysix thousand votes  each one of these is far more than we need   votes in georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age and at least  ballots were cast by individuals who moved out of the state prior to the november rd election they say they moved right back they moved right back oh they moved out they move right back okay they miss georgia that much i do i love georgia but its a corrupt system despite all of this the margin in georgia is only  votes each and every one of these issues is enough to give us a victory in georgia a big beautiful victory make no mistake this election was stolen from you from me and from the country and not a single swing state has conducted a comprehensive audit to remove the illegal ballots this should absolutely occur in every single contested state before the election is certified in the state of arizona over  ballots were illegally cast by noncitizens two thousand ballots were returned with no address more than  ballots were returned before they were ever supposedly mailed out they returned but we havent mailed them yet eleven thousand six hundred more ballots and votes were counted more than there were actual voters you see that so you have more votes again than you have voters one hundred and fifty thousand people registered in maya copa county after the registration deadline one hundred and three thousand ballots in the county were sent for electronic adjudication with no republican observers in clark county nevada the accuracy settings on signature verification machines were purposely lowered before they were used to count over  ballots if you signed your name as santa claus it would go through there were also more than  double votes in nevada over  people were hurt so badly by what took place  and  ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth matched nevada residents who died in  prior to the november rd election more than  votes were cast by individuals who had no address and probably didnt live there the margin in nevada is down at a very low number any of these things would have taken care of the situation we would have won nevada also every one of these were going over we win in michigan quickly the secretary of state a real great one flooded the state with unsolicited mailin ballot applications sent to every person on the rolls in direct violation of state law more than  michigan ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates at birth match people who were deceased in wayne county thats a great one thats detroit  ballots were counted without being tied to an actual registered voter nobody knows where they came from also in wayne county poll watchers observed canvassers rescanning batches of ballots over and over again up to three or four or five times in detroit turnout was  percent of registered voters think of that so you had  percent of the people in detroit voting this is in michigan detroit michigan a career employee of the city of detroit testified under penalty of perjury that she witnessed city workers coaching voters to vote straight democrat while accompanying them to watch who they voted for when a republican came in they wouldnt talk to him the same worker was instructed not to ask for any voter id and not to attempt to validate any signatures if they were democrats she was also told to illegally and was told to back date ballots received after the deadline and reports that thousands and thousands of ballots were improperly backdated thats michigan four witnesses have testified under penalty of perjury that after officials in detroit announced the last votes had been counted tens of thousands of additional ballots arrived without required envelopes every single one was for a democrat i got no votes at  am in the early morning hours after voting had ended michigan suddenly reported  votes an astounding  percent went to joe biden who campaigned brilliantly from his basement only a couple of percentage points went to trump such gigantic and onesided vote dumps were only observed in a few swing states and they were observed in the states where it was necessary you know whats interesting president obama beat biden in every state other than the swing states where biden killed them but the swing states were the ones that mattered theyre always just enough to push joe biden barely into the lead we were ahead by a lot and within a number of hours we were losing by a little in addition there is the highly troubling matter of dominion voting systems in one michigan county alone  votes were switched from trump to biden and the same systems are used in the majority of states in our country senator william liggins a great gentleman chairman of georgias senate judiciary subcommittee senator liggins highly respected on elections has written a letter describing his concerns with dominion in georgia he wrote and i quote the dominion voting machines employed in fulton county had an astronomical and astounding  percent error rate its only wrong  percent of the time in the scanning of ballots requiring a review panel to adjudicate or determine the voters interest in over  ballots out of a total of  think of it you go in and you vote and then they tell people who youre supposed to be voting for they make up whatever they want nobodys ever even heard they adjudicate your vote they say well we dont think trump wants to vote for trump we think he wants to vote for biden put it down for biden the national average for such an error rate is far less than one percent and yet youre at  percent the source of this astronomical error rate must be identified to determine if these machines were set up or destroyed to allow for a third party to disregard the actual ballot cast by the registered voter the letter continues there is clear evidence that tens of thousands of votes were switched from president trump to former vice president biden in several counties in georgia for example in bibb county president trump was reported to have  votes at  pm eastern time while simultaneously vice president joe biden was reported to have  minutes later just minutes at the next update these vote numbers switched with president trump going way down to  and biden going way up to  and that was very quick a  vote switch all in mr bidens favor so i mean i could go on and on about this fraud that took place in every state and all of these legislatures want this back i dont want to do it to you because i love you and its freezing out here but i could just go on forever i can tell you this crowd chants we love you so when you hear when you hear while there is no evidence to prove any wrongdoing this is the most fraudulent thing anybodys this is a criminal enterprise this is a criminal enterprise and the press will say and im sure they wont put any of that on there because thats no good did you ever see while there is no evidence to back president trumps assertion i could go on for another hour reading this stuff to you and telling you about it theres never been anything like it think about it detroit had more votes than it had voters pennsylvania had  more votes than it had more you dont have to go any more between that i think thats almost better than dead people if you think right more votes than they had voters and many other states also its a disgrace that in the united states of america tens of millions of people are allowed to go vote without so much as even showing identification in no state is there any question or effort made to verify the identity citizenship residency or eligibility of the votes cast the republicans have to get tougher youre not going to have a republican party if you dont get tougher they want to play so straight they want to play so sir yes the united states constitution doesnt allow me to send them back to the states well i say yes it does because the constitution says you have to protect our country and you have to protect our constitution and you cant vote on fraud and fraud breaks up everything doesnt it when you catch somebody in a fraud youre allowed to go by very different rules so i hope mike has the courage to do what he has to do and i hope he doesnt listen to the rinos and the stupid people that hes listening to it is also widely understood that the voter roles are crammed full of noncitizens felons and people who have moved out of state and individuals who are otherwise ineligible to vote yet democrats oppose every effort to clean up their voter rolls they dont want to clean them up theyre loaded and how many people here know other people that when the hundreds of thousands and then millions of ballots got sent out got three four five six and i heard one who got seven ballots and then they say you didnt quite make it sir we won in a landslide this was a landslide they said its not american to challenge the election this is the most corrupt election in the history maybe of the world you know you could go but third world countries but i dont think they had hundreds of thousands of votes and they dont have voters for em i mean no matter where you go nobody would think this in fact its so egregious its so bad that a lot of people dont even believe it its so crazy that people dont even believe it it cant be true so they dont believe it this is not just a matter of domestic politics this is a matter of national security so today in addition to challenging the certification of the election im calling on congress and the state legislatures to quickly pass sweeping election reforms and you better do it before we have no country left today is not the end its just the beginning with your help over the last four years we built the greatest political movement in the history of our country and nobody even challenges that i say that over and over and i never get challenged by the fake news and they challenge almost everything we say but our fight against the big donors big media big tech and others is just getting started this is the greatest in history theres never been a movement like that you look back theyre all the way to the washington monument its hard to believe we must stop the steal and then we must ensure that such outrageous election fraud never happens again can never be allowed to happen again but were going forward well take care of going forward we got to take care of going back dont let them talk okay well we promise ive had a lot of people sir youre at  for four years i said im not interested right now im interested in right there with your help we will finally pass powerful requirements for voter id you need an id to cash a check you need an id to go to a bank to buy alcohol to drive a car every person should need to show an id in order to cast your most important thing a vote we will also require proof of american citizenship in order to vote in american elections we just had a good victory in court on that one actually we will ban ballot harvesting and prohibit the use of unsecured drop boxes to commit rampant fraud these drop boxes are fraudulent they disappear and then all of a sudden they show up its fraudulent we will stop the practice of universal unsolicited mailin balloting we will clean up the voter rolls that ensure that every single person who casts a vote is a citizen of our country a resident of the state in which they vote and their vote is cast in a lawful and honest manner we will restore the vital civic tradition of inperson voting on election day so that voters can be fully informed when they make their choice we will finally hold big tech accountable crowd cheers and if these people had courage and guts they would get rid of section  something that no other company no other person in america in the world has all of these tech monopolies are going to abuse their power and interfere in our elections and it has to be stopped and the republicans have to get a lot tougher and so should the democrats they should be regulated investigated and brought to justice under the fullest extent of the law theyre totally breaking the law together we will drain the washington swamp and we will clean up the corruption in our nations capital we have done a big job on it but you think its easy its a dirty business its a dirty business you have a lot of bad people out there despite everything weve been through looking out all over this country and seeing fantastic crowds although this i think is our alltime record crowd cheers i think you have  people  looking out at all the amazing patriots here today i have never been more confident in our nations future well i have to say we have to be a little bit careful thats a nice statement but we have to be a little careful with that statement if we allow this group of people to illegally take over our country because its illegal when the votes are illegal when the way they got there is illegal when the states that vote are given false and fraudulent information we are the greatest country on earth and we are and were headed in the right direction you know the wall is built were doing record numbers at the wall now they want to take down the wall lets let everyone flow in lets let everybody flow in we did a great job on the wall remember the wall they said it could never be done one of the largest infrastructure projects weve ever had in this country and its had a tremendous impact we got rid of catch and release we got rid of all of the stuff that we had to live with but now the caravans they think bidens getting in the caravans are forming again they want to come in again and rip off our country cant let it happen as this enormous crowd shows we have truth and justice on our side we have a deep and enduring love for america in our hearts we love our country we have overwhelming pride in this great country and we have it deep in our souls together we are determined to defend and preserve government of the people by the people and for the people our brightest days are before us our greatest achievements still wait i think one of our great achievements will be election security because nobody until i came along had any idea how corrupt our elections were and again most people would stand there at  oclock in the evening and say i want to thank you very much and they go off to some other life but i said somethings wrong here somethings really wrong cant have happened and we fight we fight like hell and if you dont fight like hell youre not going to have a country anymore our exciting adventures and boldest endeavors have not yet begun my fellow americans for our movement for our children and for our beloved country and i say this despite all thats happened the best is yet to come crowd cheers so were going to were going to walk down pennsylvania avenue  i love pennsylvania avenue  and were going to the capitol and were going to try and give the democrats are hopeless theyre never voting for anything not even one vote but were going to try and give our republicans the weak ones because the strong ones dont need any of our help were going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country so lets walk down pennsylvania avenue i want to thank you all god bless you and god bless america thank you all for being here this is incredible thank you very much  this work
