# Python Introduction – In Jupyter

This is a python introduction course in a Jupyter notebook. It consists of 14 chapters (so far), covering the basics in the python programming language. 

## Usage – for the beginner

### 1. Install Anaconda

The best way to quickly get into the course is to download [the Anaconda software package](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads). By using Anaconda, you can be sure you get all Jupyter installations needed to run the course notebook. For Max OS, you get to choose between command line installation and the graphical installer. For beginners, the graphical installer is recommended! 

When you've downloaded the Anaconda package, open it and follow the installation instructions as recommended. It is a big package being installed, so the installation may take some time. Also, when installing, you will be asked if you want to install VSCode. It is a great code editor, but it is not required in this course. 

### 2. Open Anaconda Navigator

When you've successfully installed Anaconda, open the Anaconda Navigator program. In Mac, you will find it in your launchpad overview:
